ðŸ“˜ Major Project 1: Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression
Abstract

The prediction of diabetes at an early stage is crucial for preventing severe health complications. This project applies a Logistic Regression model on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to predict the likelihood of diabetes occurrence based on patient health attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, and age. The model provides an interpretable and efficient solution for binary classification problems in healthcare analytics.

Objectives

To analyze patient health data and identify significant attributes influencing diabetes.

To implement Logistic Regression for binary classification (diabetes/no diabetes).

To evaluate the model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

To demonstrate the role of machine learning in medical decision support.

Methodology

Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle).

Data preprocessing: Cleaning and feature separation.

Train-test split: 80-20 ratio.

Model: Logistic Regression using scikit-learn.

Evaluation: Accuracy score and confusion matrix.

Results

The Logistic Regression classifier successfully predicted diabetes outcomes with a reasonable accuracy score. The model highlighted glucose level, insulin, and BMI as key factors influencing predictions.

Conclusion

Logistic Regression proved to be a reliable model for early-stage diabetes prediction. This project demonstrates how AI-driven predictive models can assist in healthcare diagnostics and patient risk assessment.

ðŸ“˜ Major Project 2: Sales Prediction using Linear Regression
Abstract

Understanding the impact of advertising expenditure on sales is critical for businesses. This project utilizes a Linear Regression model to predict sales based on spending in TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertisements. The study highlights the contribution of each medium toward sales performance and enables data-driven marketing strategies.

Objectives

To explore the relationship between advertisement spending and sales.

To apply Linear Regression for continuous target prediction.

To compare predicted and actual sales using evaluation metrics.

To suggest business insights from advertising channels.

Methodology

Dataset: Advertising Dataset.

Features: TV, Radio, Newspaper expenditure.

Target: Sales.

Model: Linear Regression using scikit-learn.

Evaluation: MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score.

Results

The model achieved a high RÂ² score, indicating that advertisement spending explains a significant portion of the variance in sales. Among all media, TV and Radio spending showed the strongest positive correlation with sales, while Newspaper had the least impact.

Conclusion

Linear Regression effectively modeled the relationship between advertisement costs and sales. The analysis provides businesses with actionable insights to optimize their advertising budgets, maximizing returns on investment.
